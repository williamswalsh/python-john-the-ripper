AUTOMATED EMAIL - DO NOT REPLY
==============================

Dear ${systemuser.getFullName()},

     You will shortly receive a digitally-signed email from the Digitary secure electronic document system here at Framework University. The digital signature on this email is to assure you that the email actually came from this system.

     IMPORTANT!!! When you receive this email, your email client may display the email as "untrusted". This is because your software does not currently trust the digital certificates used by our system. Our digital certificates are issued by the eCommerce division of An Post, the Irish state-owned postal service. 

     To enable trust for these certificates, you may download them from the Digitary Framework University website:

     https://digitary.framework.ie/pci_root.cer (Post Trust Root CA Certificate)
     https://digitary.framework.ie/pci_int.cer  (Post Trust Operational CA Certificate)

     Alternatively, you may download both certificates directly from the Post Trust website:

     http://www.post.trust.ie/reposit/rootcert.html

     Follow the instructions on screen to install the certificates.
